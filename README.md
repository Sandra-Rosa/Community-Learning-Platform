# LEARNSQUAD

<p>Hey there! We’re excited to present Learn Squad, our online community platform. Our goal is to develop an open-source digital platform that enables communities to collaborate, learn, and share resources. We've designed a basic front end, but our main focus was on the Figma prototype. I'll walk you through the different pages, such as the signup and login pages, the user profile, the courses registry, quiz page and the discussions page. We've also added an innovative feature - collaboration with Chat GPT, you don’t have to wait for the answers from the community, instead you can directly ask chatgpt, to make learning easier . Additionally, we have a study groups page where you can create groups and study together. We plan to develop this platform using MERN stack. Take a look and let us know what you think!</p>

## Problem Statement:

How can we develop an open-source digital platform that enables communities to collaborate, learn, and share resources?
